## Usage

Before you can use this library, you need to create a new project on a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform</a>.
You need to create OAuth Client ID <i>(ANDROID & WEB)</i>, because you will need that same Client ID (WEB), in order to implement One-Tap Sign in with Google.
</br></br>
After that, just call `OneTapSignInWithGoogle()` function, and pass that same information you've obtained through Google Cloud Platform.
You will also pass `OneTapSignInState`, because that state is used later to trigger One-Tap dialog.

```kotlin
    val state = rememberOneTapSignInState()
    OneTapSignInWithGoogle(
        state = state,
        clientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
        onTokenIdReceived = { tokenId ->
            Log.d("LOG", tokenId)
        },
        onDialogDismissed = { message ->
            Log.d("LOG", message)
        }
    )
```

To trigger One-Tap dialog, just call `open()` function.

```kotlin
Button(onClick = { state.open() }) {
    Text(text = "Sign in")
}
```

## Troubleshoot
In some cases you may encounter <i>"Google Account not Found."</i> message inside `onDialogDismiss` lambda, even if you have already connected a Google account
on your Android Emulator. Android emulators are prone to that issues <i>(Not sure why and when that's gonna get fixed)</i>.
My suggestion in that case is to try and add a Google account on some other Android Emulator.
If that doesn't work either, then use a real device instead.
